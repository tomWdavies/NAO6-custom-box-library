# NAO6-custom-box-library
My custon box library for the Aldebaran/Softbank Robotics/United Robot Group NAO6. Includes boxes that fix issues with NAO falling on carpet when trying to walk (Carpet Shuffle) and templates for useful interaction building blocks. Let me know if you need explanation, or use or develop my boxes!
